python-midpoint 
===========================================

Overview
--------
This is a python library for interacting with midpoint. It's actually a warpper around midPoint's existing RESTfull API and as such perfromance may suffer. 


Exiting Features
----------------
As of the last commit there is support for the following objects:

* Users
* Roles
* Resources 
* Shadows 

Most of the operations are limitied to reading existing objects and modifying them via MidPoint's itemDelta mechanism.

Coming Soon 
-----------

* Creating New Objects 
* Deleting Existing Objects 
* Wrapers for Object functions such as (most of these can be done today with existing schema):
	- Assign To Role 
	- Check User Role Membership
	- etc
